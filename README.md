# Steady-Heat-Conduction

- My first CFD code, which was offered as an assignment in the course **Basics of Computational Fluid Dynamics** (2015) during my bachelor
studies.

**Description** : A simple CFD code to study the temperature distribution in a slab subjected to steady state heat conduction

- Dirichlet Temperature boundary conditions are specified at all four sides of the slab
- User can opt for Point Gauss Siedel Method [1], Line Gauss Siedel Method [2] , Successive Over Relaxation (SOR)
